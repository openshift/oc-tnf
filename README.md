# oc-tnf

OpenShift CLI plugin for Two Node with Fencing (TNF) cluster utilities.

## Install

### Via Krew (custom index)

```bash
kubectl krew index add openshift https://github.com/openshift/krew-index.git
kubectl krew install openshift/tnf
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openshift/oc-tnf.git
cd oc-tnf
make build
make install
```

## Commands

### validate-fencing

Validates fencing on a TNF (DualReplica) cluster by power-cycling both nodes sequentially via STONITH and verifying full recovery.

**WARNING: This is a DISRUPTIVE operation.** Nodes will be forcibly powered off via STONITH and must recover automatically. Only run this against a TNF cluster you intend to test.

**What it checks:**

1. Pre-flight: STONITH configured and enabled, both nodes online in Pacemaker, corosync/pacemaker/pcsd daemons active, etcd has 2 healthy voter members
2. Fences each node sequentially via `pcs stonith fence`
3. Waits for fenced node to go NotReady, then recover to Ready
4. Verifies Pacemaker rejoin and etcd quorum restoration
5. Warns if fencing takes >60s (possible BMC graceful shutdown)

**Usage:**

```bash
# Using default kubeconfig and SSH agent
oc tnf validate-fencing

# With explicit SSH key
oc tnf validate-fencing --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# With explicit kubeconfig
oc tnf validate-fencing --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Prerequisites:**

- A deployed DualReplica (TNF) cluster — rejects non-TNF clusters with a clear error
- SSH access to both control-plane nodes as `core` user
- Cluster-admin kubeconfig

## Development

```bash
make build          # Build for current platform
make test           # Run unit tests
make golangci-lint  # Run linter
make cross-build    # Build for all platforms
make release-dry-run # Test GoReleaser without publishing
